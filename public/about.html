<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a student at the University of Winnipeg, studying for a Bachelor of Science with a major in Applied Computer Science 
I am a tech geek and AI enthusiast. I love coding and building gaming computers.
</p>

<p>I am currently working on my goal to become a Web Developer. Ever since I took my first course in Web Development 
and watched my fellow developer friends build websites and web apps, I have been fascinated. The high level of creativity 
one can use to make their unique version of a website is the expertise I want to gain by learning web development.
</p>

<p>I am super excited with the practical application of modern AI innovations happening in the current world, 
such as autonomous driving vehicles like Tesla and Generative AI chatbots like CHAT-gpt. Yet both of the technologies 
are still in their experimentation and development stage they provide us with vision of the future that how AI will transform the world.
